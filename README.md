## ðŸš€ About Me

I'm a software engineer specializing in asynchronous programming patterns and distributed systems. My passion lies in building scalable, non-blocking applications that can handle thousands of concurrent operations efficiently.

```javascript
const life = async () => {
  while (true) {
    await Promise.all([
      learnNewTechnologies(),
      buildCoolStuff(),
      shareKnowledge(),
      drinkCoffee()
    ]);
  }
};
```

## ðŸ’» Tech Stack

- **Languages**: JavaScript/TypeScript, Python, Rust, Go
- **Runtime**: Node.js, Deno
- **Frameworks**: 
  - Express.js
  - FastAPI
  - Tokio
- **Message Brokers**: RabbitMQ, Apache Kafka
- **Databases**: 
  - MongoDB
  - PostgreSQL
  - Redis

## ðŸŽ¯ Current Focus

- Exploring Rust async/await patterns
- Building distributed tracing solutions
- Contributing to open-source async libraries
- Writing about concurrent programming patterns
